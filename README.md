About me...
My name is Allan Constanza, I am a third year computer science major, and I am from the Bay Area. I am studying computer science in hopes of one day becoming a software engineer. At the moment, I am most interested in learning more about A.I. and would like to start creating projects with it. Aside from computer science, I also enjoy music a lot as well as photography.
