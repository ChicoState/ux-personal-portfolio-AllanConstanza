# Desktop Apple Music

I use Apple Music on a daily basis. It is a music streaming platform that is exclusive to only Apple products. Although other music streaming platforms are available, I find Apple Music to be the most convenient streaming platform for me. A common feature for Apple Music and every music streaming platform is the back button. It is one of the most basic features that any streaming platform should have. 

When listening to most playlists, like playlists that I have made myself, or shuffling every song I have downloaded from my library, the back button is available. For example, here I am playing the entirety of Calvin Harris’ album. As seen at the top of the screen,common **conventions** like both the _back and shuffle buttons_ are available.<img width="1552" alt="Screenshot 2024-03-17 at 5 52 04 PM" src="https://github.com/ChicoState/ux-personal-portfolio-AllanConstanza/assets/75638009/81204701-d226-4ef1-b60d-9df6c7371ccc">

However, when using Apple Music on my Macbook, the back button does not function with certain playlists. This is a major inconvenience, especially when playing the “Discovery Station”, a playlist created by Apple Music that chooses song recommendations for each user.

I often multitask when listening to music and sometimes forget to check the title of each song. The issue arises when I enjoy a song and want to add it to my personal libray, but no longer can as Apple Music won't let me go back one song. The only work around this issue is attempting to remember the lyrics of a song and hoping to find it online. This is where a back button would be very **useful**. Without it, I am not able to **recover from the error.**
