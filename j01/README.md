# Desktop Apple Music

I use Apple Music on a daily basis. It is a music streaming platform that is exclusive to only Apple products. I love listening to music everywhere I go, whether it’s walking to class or just doing homework, and I have an iPhone and a macbook, so Apple Music is the most convenient streaming platform for me. A common feature for Apple Music and every music streaming platform is the back button. It is one of the most basic features that any streaming platform should have. 

When listening to most playlists, like playlists that I have made myself, or shuffling every song I have downloaded from my library, the back button is available. For example, here I am playing the entirety of Calvin Harris’ album. As seen at the top of the screen,common **conventions** like both the _back and shuffle buttons_ are available. <img width="1552" alt="Screenshot 2024-03-17 at 5 52 04 PM" src="https://github.com/ChicoState/ux-personal-portfolio-AllanConstanza/assets/75638009/81204701-d226-4ef1-b60d-9df6c7371ccc">



However, when using Apple Music on my Macbook, the back button does not function with certain playlists. This is a major inconvenience, especially when playing the playlist “Discovery Station”, a playlist in which the Apple Music algorithm chooses songs that appeal to each user.

Several times I have listened to a new song on this playlist while completing a different task simultaneously. Once the song is over and I decide that I want to add it to my personal library, I can no longer go back and see the title of the song and have no way of finding it again unless I search it up by its lyrics.This is where a back button would be very **useful**. Without it, I am not able to **recover from the error.**
